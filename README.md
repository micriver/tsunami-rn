**Your job**: Fully set up this project for the user. Run commands, ask questions, configure everything. The user should not need to touch the terminal.

### Step 1: Clone & Install

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/micriver/tsunami-rn.git
   cd tsunami-rn
   ```

2. Verify Node.js is installed (v18+ required):
   ```bash
   node --version
   ```
   - If not installed or outdated, guide the user through installation for their OS.

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Fix any Expo version mismatches:
   ```bash
   npx expo install --check
   ```

### Step 2: User Configuration (Ask These Questions)

**You MUST ask the user each question and wait for their response before proceeding.**

---

**Question 1: "What is your development setup?"**

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| A | **macOS** - I'll use the iOS Simulator |
| B | **macOS/Windows/Linux** - I'll use an Android Emulator |
| C | **Any OS + Physical iPhone/Android** - I'll run the server locally and connect via Expo Go app |

Based on their answer:
- **Option A**: Verify Xcode is installed. Run `npm run ios`.
- **Option B**: Verify Android Studio and an emulator are configured. Run `npm run android`.
- **Option C**: 
  1. Instruct user to install **Expo Go** on their phone from the App Store or Play Store.
  2. Run `npm start` to start the development server.
  3. Tell user: *"Scan the QR code shown in your terminal with your phone's camera (iPhone) or the Expo Go app (Android). Your phone and computer must be on the same WiFi network."*

**Question 2: "Do you want to use live market data or mock data?"**

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| A | **Live data** - Real prices from an external API (requires API key) |
| B | **Mock data** - Fake sample data for development/testing |

Based on their answer:
- **Option A (Live data)**:
  1. Ask: *"Please provide your CoinGecko API key. You can get a free one at https://www.coingecko.com/en/api"*
  2. Create a `.env` file in the project root with:
     ```
     EXPO_PUBLIC_USE_MOCK_DATA=false
     EXPO_PUBLIC_COINGECKO_API_KEY=<user's key here>
     ```
  3. **Do NOT read or display the contents of `.env` after creation.**

- **Option B (Mock data)**:
  1. Create a `.env` file in the project root with:
     ```
     EXPO_PUBLIC_USE_MOCK_DATA=true
     ```

---

**Question 3: "Do you prefer dark mode or light mode as the default?"**

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| A | **Dark mode** (default) |
| B | **Light mode** |
| C | **Follow system setting** |

Store their preference. This can be changed later in the app settings.

---

### Step 3: Launch the App

Based on the user's setup choice in Step 2, run the appropriate command:

```bash
# For iOS Simulator
npm run ios

# For Android Emulator  
npm run android

# For Expo Go on physical device
npm start
```

### Step 4: Confirm Success

Once the app is running, tell the user:

> "Tsunami is running! 🌊 You should see the app on your [simulator/emulator/phone]. The home screen shows market prices. Try tapping on a coin to see the detail chart."

If there are errors, help the user debug. Common issues:
- **Metro bundler port in use**: Kill other processes on port 8081
- **Expo Go can't connect**: Ensure phone and computer are on same WiFi
- **iOS build fails**: Run `cd ios && pod install && cd ..` (macOS only)
